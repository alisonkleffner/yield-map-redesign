**Abstract** 

A standard method to display the relationship between two variables is through visualization. However, if these variables occupy the same spatial domain, there is difficulty in perceiving any statistical relationships between the data. Data occupying the same spatial domain is common in the agricultural field, and while visualizations in this area exist, they do not conform to the principles of effective chart design. As a motivating example to illustrate challenges and potential solutions, we examined visualizing the relationship between crop input application and crop yield. Understanding this relationship is crucial as inefficiently applying crop inputs, like nitrogen fertilizer, impacts profit and the environment. The purpose of the Data Intensive Farm Management (DIFM) project is to allow farmers to run experiments that establish the effect of crop application on yield in specific locations. These trials, called On-Farm Precision Experiments (OFPE), leverage the ability to precisely control the application type and rate using GPS-enabled machinery while conducting these experiments. While maps attempting to display this relationship exist, they do not follow the principles of effective chart design. Our objectives are to identify the perceptual issues in current visualizations from our motivating example and to propose plots to mitigate these challenges. By documenting the process of improving graphics to increase comprehension and ease of use, these ideas can be used with similar data in the agricultural field to display it better. Visualizing the data more effectively makes the information presented more attainable for more people and may allow further insight into the data.
